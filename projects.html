    <h2>
        JEBS: A Fine-grained Biomedical Lexical Simplification Task
    </h2>
    June 2023 - Present
    <p>
        The culmination of my two summer research internships at the National
        Library of Medicine (2023-2024). For this project, I annotated a text
        simplification dataset of over 1,200 sentence pairs, and developed a suite
        of language models for identifying non-consumer biomedical terms in
        research abstracts as well as generating explanations for those terms. These
        models were fine-tuned from pre-trained versions of BERT and Llama-3.
    </p>
    <p>
        I presented this work for National Institutes of Health Summer Intern
        Program Poster Day in both 2023 and 2024. Additionally, I presented
        the dataset for this project for the
        <a href="https://bionlp.nlm.nih.gov/plaba2024/">PLABA</a>
        track at
        <a href="https://trec.nist.gov/pubs/call2024.html">TREC 2024</a>. I
        also first-authored a paper about this project, which was submitted to
        ACL in February, 2025.

    <h2>
        RAG Pinterest Content Sharing Customer Support Chatbot
    </h2>
    April 2025
    <p>
        A full stack webapp built around a customer-support LLM chatbot. The
        chatbot was supplemented with a knowledge graph for retrieval-augmented
        generation (RAG). I used LangChain and Ollama for the LLM portion of
        the webapp, with Neo4j serving as the RAG graph database. The backend
        for this program was held together using Flask and the frontend was
        implemented with React.js. I created this webapp as part of the
        interview process with Dassault Syst√®mes.

    <h2>
        Statistical Token Classifier for Identifying Medical Terms
    </h2>
    March - April 2024
    <p>
    My final project from when I took CS 136 (Statistical Pattern Recognition)
    at Tufts in the spring of 2024. I developed a Categorical-Dirichlet
    statistical language model to identify complex biomedical terms in academic
    texts. This project was inspired by the work I did at the National Library
    of Medicine during the summer of 2023.

        Alchemist's Dungeon
    </h2>
    February 2022
    <p>
    A 2D video game I made for my midterm project from when I took CS 23 (Game
    Design) at Tufts in the spring of 2022. I worked on this project with three
    other classmates. Alchemist's Dungeon is a single-player puzzle game, where
    the player must navigate levels with slippery floors to collect potion ingredients.
