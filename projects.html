    <h2>
        Grounding Large Language Models with Natural Language World Models
    </h2>
    September 2024 - May 2025
    <p>
        For my Senior Honors Thesis, I explored how natural language could be
        used to ground LLMs to embodied environments. To do so, I implemented
        a novel OpenAI Gym environment for embodied puzzle solving, and
        compared the performance of LLMs and reinforcement learning agents
        on various embodied puzzle-solving tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
        My results reveal a clear divide between what LLMs claim to know and
        what they actually understand, pointing the way for future work on
        grounding LLMs to embodied environments.

    <h2>
        JEBS: A Fine-grained Biomedical Lexical Simplification Task
    </h2>
    June 2023 - May 2025
    <p>
        The culmination of my two summer research internships at the National
        Library of Medicine (2023-2024). For this project, I annotated a text
        simplification dataset of over 1,200 sentence pairs, and developed a suite
        of language models for identifying and simplifying non-consumer
        biomedical terms in research abstracts as well as generating explanations
        for those terms. For this project, I used a number of fine-tuned and
        off-the-shelf open-source language models.
    </p>
    <p>
        I presented this work at National Institutes of Health Summer Intern
        Program Poster Day in both 2023 and 2024,
        <a href="https://trec.nist.gov/pubs/call2024.html">TREC 2024</a>, and
        <a href="https://2025.aclweb.org/">ACL 2025</a>. My first-authored
        paper on this project was published in the Proceedings of ACL 2025.

    <h2>
        RAG Pinterest Content Sharing Customer Support Chatbot
    </h2>
    April 2025
    <p>
        A full stack webapp built around a customer-support LLM chatbot. The
        chatbot was supplemented with a knowledge graph for retrieval-augmented
        generation (RAG). I used LangChain and Ollama for the LLM portion of
        the webapp, with Neo4j serving as the RAG graph database. The backend
        for this program was held together using Flask and the frontend was
        implemented with React.js. I created this webapp as part of the
        interview process for an internship position at Dassault Syst√®mes.

    <h2>
        Statistical Token Classifier for Identifying Medical Terms
    </h2>
    March - April 2024
    <p>
    My final project from when I took CS 136 (Statistical Pattern Recognition)
    at Tufts in the spring of 2024. I developed a Categorical-Dirichlet
    statistical language model to identify complex biomedical terms in academic
    texts. This project was inspired by the work I did at the National Library
    of Medicine during the summer of 2023.

        Alchemist's Dungeon
    </h2>
    February 2022
    <p>
    A 2D video game I made for my midterm project from when I took CS 23 (Game
    Design) at Tufts in the spring of 2022. I worked on this project with three
    other classmates. Alchemist's Dungeon is a single-player puzzle game, where
    the player must navigate levels with slippery floors to collect potion ingredients.
