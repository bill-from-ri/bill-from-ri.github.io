    <h2>
        Identifying and Simplifying Non-consumer Terminology in Biomedical Abstracts
    </h2>
    June 2023 - Present
    <p>
        The culmination of my two summer research internships at the National
        Library of Medicine (2023-2024). For this project, I annotated a text
        simplification dataset of over 1,200 sentence pairs, and developed a suite
        of language models for identifying non-consumer biomedical terms in
        research abstracts as well as generating explanations for those terms. These
        models were fine-tuned from pre-trained versions of BERT and Llama-3.
    </p>
    <p>
        I presented this work for National Institutes of Health Summer Intern
        Program Poster Day in both 2023 and 2024. Additionally, I presented
        the dataset for this project for the
        <a href="https://bionlp.nlm.nih.gov/plaba2024/">PLABA</a>
        track at
        <a href="https://trec.nist.gov/pubs/call2024.html">TREC 2024</a>.

    <h2>
        Statistical Token Classifier for Identifying Medical Terms
    </h2>
    March - April 2024
    <p>
    My final project from when I took CS 136 (Statistical Pattern Recognition)
    at Tufts in the spring of 2024. I developed a Categorical-Dirichlet
    statistical language model to identify complex biomedical terms in academic
    texts. This project was inspired by the work I did at the National Library
    of Medicine during the summer of 2023.

        Catacombs
    </h2>
    April 2022
    <p>
    My final project from when I took CS 23 (Game Design) at Tufts in the
    spring of 2022. I made this game with three other classmates.

    <h2>
        Alchemist's Dungeon
    </h2>
    February 2022
    <p>
    A 2D video game I made for my midterm project from when I took CS 23 (Game
    Design) at Tufts in the spring of 2022. I worked on this project with three
    other classmates. Alchemist's Dungeon is a single-player puzzle game, where
    the player must navigate levels with slippery floors to collect potion ingredients.
