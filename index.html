    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p class="norm-text">
        Hello! I am currently working as an AI Product Management Intern at
        <a href="https://www.solidworks.com/">Dassault Systèmes SolidWorks</a>.
        I graduated from Tufts University in May 2025 with a BS in Computer
        Science and minors in English and Mathematics.
    </p>
    <p class="norm-text">
        My work mainly deals with natural language processing. Specifically, 
        I have worked on numerous projects centered around large language
        models, with topics including biomedical text simplification,
        information retrieval, and AI agents.
    </p>
    <p class="norm-text">
        I was previously a Summer Research Intern at the National Library of
        Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). My work at
        the NLM primarily revolved around
        <a href="https://bionlp.nlm.nih.gov/plaba2024/">PLABA</a>. As part of
        my internship, I developed a suite of language models capable to
        identifying complex terms in biomedical abstracts and producing
        consumer-friendly simplifications for those terms.
    </p>

    <h3>Recent Projects</h3>
    <p class="norm-text">
        <b>Senior Honors Thesis.</b> I recently defended and submitted my Senior
        Honors Thesis, under the advisorship of Professor Vasanth Sarathy and
        Professor Matthias Scheutz. My project involved using natural language
        world models to ground LLMs to embodied puzzle environments. 
        <!-- I hope to show that LLMs can detect patterns in these environments to learn the "rules" of the puzzles. -->
    </p>
    <p class="norm-text">
        <b>Senior Capstone Project.</b> In addition to my Senior Thesis,
        I also worked on a Senior Capstone Project this year with two of my
        classmates. Our client was
        <a href="https://www.asldeafined.com/">ASLDeafined</a>,
        an American Sign Language education website. We integrated an AI-powered,
        Duolingo-like activity generation system into their website.
