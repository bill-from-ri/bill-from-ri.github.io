    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p class="norm-text">
        Hello! I am a senior at Tufts University working towards a BS in Computer
        Science with minors in English and Mathematics. After college, I will be
        returning to Tufts to pursue a Fifth-Year Masters Degree in Artificial
        Intelligence.
    </p>
    <p class="norm-text">
        My research interests are centered around grounding large language models
        via language and symbolic methods, both for domain-specific NLP tasks
        like biomedical text simplification and information retrieval, as well
        as for embodied scenarios like autonomous search-and-rescue and
        exploration tasks.
    </p>
    <p class="norm-text">
        I was previously a Summer Research Intern at the National Library of
        Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). My work at the NLM
        primarily revolved around <a href="https://bionlp.nlm.nih.gov/plaba2024/">PLABA</a>.
        As part of my internship, I developed a suite of language models capable to identifying complex terms in biomedical
        abstracts and producing consumer-friendly simplifications for those terms.
    </p>

    <h3>Recent Projects</h3>
    <p class="norm-text">
        <b>Senior Honors Thesis.</b> I recently defended and submitted my Senior
        Honors Thesis, under the advisorship of Professor Vasanth Sarathy and
        Professor Matthias Scheutz. My project involved using natural language
        world models to ground LLMs to embodied puzzle environments. 
        <!-- I hope to show that LLMs can detect patterns in these environments to learn the "rules" of the puzzles. -->
    </p>
    <p class="norm-text">
        <b>Senior Capstone Project.</b> In addition to my Senior Thesis,
        I also worked on a Senior Capstone Project this year with two of my
        classmates. Our client was
        <a href="https://www.asldeafined.com/">ASLDeafined</a>,
        an American Sign Language education website. We integrated an AI-powered,
        Duolingo-like activity generation system into their website.
