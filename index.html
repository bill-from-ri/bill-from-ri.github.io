    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p class="norm-text">
        Hello! I am currently working as an AI Product Management Intern at
        <a href="https://www.solidworks.com/">Dassault Systèmes SolidWorks</a>.
        I graduated from Tufts University in May 2025 with a BS in Computer
        Science and minors in English and Mathematics.
    </p>
    <p class="norm-text">
        My work mainly deals with natural language processing. Specifically, 
        I have worked on numerous projects centered around large language
        models, with topics including biomedical text simplification,
        information retrieval, and AI agents.
    </p>
    <p class="norm-text">
        I was previously a Summer Research Intern at the National Library of
        Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). My work at
        the NLM primarily revolved around
        <a href="https://bionlp.nlm.nih.gov/plaba2024/">PLABA</a>. As part of
        my internship, I developed <a href="publications.html">JEBS</a>,
        a novel biomedical lexical simplification task and dataset. I presented
        JEBS at ACL 2025 in Vienna, Austria.
    </p>

    <h3>Recent Projects</h3>
    <p class="norm-text">
        <b>Senior Honors Thesis.</b> Advised by Professor Vasanth Sarathy and
        Professor Matthias Scheutz, my Senior Honors Thesis explored the divide
        between natural language "understanding" and implicit knowledge in LLMs.
        <!-- I hope to show that LLMs can detect patterns in these environments to learn the "rules" of the puzzles. -->
    </p>
    <p class="norm-text">
        <b>Senior Capstone Project.</b> In addition to my thesis, I worked on
        a Senior Capstone Project during my final year of college. My team's client was
        <a href="https://www.asldeafined.com/">ASLDeafined</a>,
        an American Sign Language education website. We integrated an AI-powered,
        Duolingo-like activity generation system into their website.
