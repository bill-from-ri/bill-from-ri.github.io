    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p class="norm-text">
        Hello! I am a senior at Tufts University working towards a BS in Computer
        Science with minors in English and Mathematics. After college, I plan to
        pursue a PhD in Computer Science. I'm currently waiting to hear back from
        the programs I applied to this fall.
    </p>
    <p class="norm-text">
        My research interests are centered around how neuro-symbolic machine
        learning systems (such as LLMs and VLMs) can be used to solve embodied
        reasoning problems.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Current Projects</h3>
    <p class="norm-text">
        <b class="norm-bold">National Institutes of Health (NIH).</b> I am
        currently wrapping up my projects at the National Library
        of Medicine of NIH, which primarily revolve around
        <a href="https://bionlp.nlm.nih.gov/plaba2024/">PLABA</a>. I have developed
        a suite of language models capable to identifying complex terms in biomedical
        abstracts and producing consumer-friendly replacements for those terms.
        It's my hope that the final product can help improve medical and scientific
        literacy for the general public. I hope to submit a manuscript detailing
        my results to ACL for publication before February 20th.
    </p>
    <p class="norm-text">
        <b class="norm-bold">Senior Honors Thesis.</b> I am currently pursuing a Senior Honors Thesis
        under the advisorship of Professor Vasanth Sarathy and Professor Matthias
        Scheutz. My project involves using an LLM to generate neuro-symbolic world
        models of puzzle game environments. I hope to show that LLMs can detect
        patterns in these environments to learn the "rules" of the puzzles. I hope
        to submit a paper detailing my results to NeurIPS in early May.
    </p>
    
    <h3>News</h3>
    <p class="norm-text news-list">
        <b class="norm-bold">November 20, 2024.</b> I co-presented the introduction to the PLABA Track
        with Dr. Brian Ondov at TREC 2024.
