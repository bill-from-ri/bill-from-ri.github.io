    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p class="norm-text">
        Hello! I am a senior at Tufts University working towards a BS in Computer
        Science with minors in English and Mathematics. After college, I plan to
        pursue a PhD in Computer Science. I'm currently waiting to hear back from
        the programs I applied to this fall.
    </p>
    <p class="norm-text">
        My research interests are centered around neuro-symbolic machine
        learning systems (such as LLMs and VLMs) and how they can be used to
        solve embodied reasoning problems.
    </p>
    <p class="norm-text">
        I was previously a Summer Research Intern at the National Library of
        Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). My work at the NLM
        primarily revolved around <a href="https://bionlp.nlm.nih.gov/plaba2024/">PLABA</a>.
        As part of my internship, I developed a suite of language models capable to identifying complex terms in biomedical
        abstracts and producing consumer-friendly replacements for those terms.
    </p>

    <h3>Current Projects</h3>
    <p class="norm-text">
        <b>Senior Honors Thesis.</b> I am currently pursuing a Senior Honors Thesis
        under the advisorship of Professor Vasanth Sarathy and Professor Matthias
        Scheutz. My project involves using an LLM to generate neuro-symbolic world
        models of puzzle game environments. I hope to show that LLMs can detect
        patterns in these environments to learn the "rules" of the puzzles.
    </p>
    <p class="norm-text">
        <b>Senior Capstone Project.</b> In addition to my Senior Thesis,
        I am also working on a Senior Capstone Project with three of my classmates.
        Our client is
        <a href="https://www.asldeafined.com/">ASLDeafined</a>, an American Sign Language
        education website. We are working to integrate an AI-powered question
        selector into their existing lesson creation system.
    </p>

    <h3>News</h3>
    <p class="norm-text news-list">
        <b class="norm-bold">November 20, 2024.</b> I co-presented the introduction to the PLABA Track
        with Dr. Brian Ondov at TREC 2024.
